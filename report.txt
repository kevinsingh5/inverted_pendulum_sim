        Assignment 2 report for team KnightRider


We have 2 PID controllers, each with the PD components active, one for the angle, another for the position. The error for the 
    position was clamped to a magnitude of 1.0 meter.
All of our constants for the controllers were 1, except for the constant for the velocity of the car, which was e (2.71).
The controllers were then scaled by different amounts, the angle controller was scaled * 100, whereas the position controller
    was scaled * 10.
The entire output for the action was then multiplied by the original factor (0.01745).


Our test cases involved using two cars and positioning the second car to either side of the first car as well as either side
    of the first car's direction of motion.
We also tested using different start and finishing postions.


The files submitted are the following:
    ControlServer.java - here we implemented our PID controllers and modified the parameters of calculate_action()
    Physics.java - part of adding a second car to the simulation


To run our simulation, use the same instructions as the original README provided:
    make all
    make server
    make client (on different terminal)

    The original position for car 1 is -2.0 and its desired position is 2.0
    The original position for car 2 is 2.0 and its desired position is 1.5 meters from car 1
    
    This configuration involves balancing the pole, balancing the pole while changing position and 
        balancing two poles at a particular distance without crashing them.
